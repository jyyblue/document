Hi,

A test to prove that you are proficient in React is now available for you.

Before starting:

Disable any ad blockers, translation, or text editing extensions in your browser. They interfere with the functioning of the platform.
Ensure a reliable internet connection.
Consider that navigating other tabs will count as plagiarism. This doesn’t impact your final score, but the system measures the plagiarism level.
The test is constantly monitored.
Keep the tab open throughout the test. If you close the tab, the test will end.
You cannot install additional tools in the code editor.
You have a search engine in the editor interface. Using it doesn’t impact your score.
Make sure you submit each coding solution properly by clicking on “Submit” and then confirm.
After submitting each coding challenge, you must return to the main test page to continue or to submit it if you have already finished all the challenges.
After reading it, click the link below to get started.

You only have one attempt to complete once you start.
