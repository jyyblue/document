my plan is below:
1. ticket -> email
- you buy one smtp to use in project to send mail
- i should config provided smtp account in project
- Create email template and add mail logic
Send mail only when user create ticket in site.
2. email -> ticket
- you should register zapier account and give me.
- I will set up zapier mail parser and trigger in zapier.
- you config mail to forward to zapier
- I will create api to create ticket from email.
